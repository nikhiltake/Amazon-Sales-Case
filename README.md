🚀 Project Title: Amazon Product Analysis Using MySQL | Discount & Review Insights

Thrilled to share my latest project — a data analysis case study on Amazon products using MySQL, where I explored discount patterns, review sentiments, and pricing strategies. This project helped me strengthen my SQL querying skills while deriving practical business insights from e-commerce data.

📊 Key Highlights of the Project:

✔ Data Exploration & Filtering with SQL

🔹 Filtered products based on discount percentages, pricing trends, and star ratings

🔹 Retrieved all products with discounted prices below ₹500 for affordability analysis

🔹 Identified high-performing products with ratings 4⭐ and above and actual prices > ₹1000

🔹 Displayed products where the discounted price ends in ‘9’ – a classic pricing psychology trick!

✔ Customer Sentiment Analysis

🔹 Queried reviews containing negative terms like "worst", "waste", "poor", and "not good"

🔹 Filtered review contents mentioning "fast charging" for brand reputation and feature tracking

🔹 Mapped keywords in reviews to product names for improved insight on customer feedback

✔ Discount & Category Trends

🔹 Calculated and converted discount percentages to readable formats for better analysis

🔹 Found products with 50%+ discounts and grouped them category-wise

🔹 Listed all products falling under “Accessories” to identify category performance

💡 What I Learned:

This project sharpened my SQL skills, especially in handling textual data, percentages, and conditional filtering. I also understood how e-commerce platforms can leverage structured queries for improving product strategy, pricing, and customer satisfaction.

📈 Next Steps:

I’m currently working on visualizing this data in Power BI for a more interactive storytelling experience. Stay tuned! 😄
